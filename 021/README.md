# Cells Sticker

This particular piece looks like the geometry would take a lot of lines of code to generate, but it ended up being a fairly terse few lines of codes using my quad geometry tools. I created a box, then sudvidivided it, and finally extruded each cell face out multiple times into space with slight rotations.
